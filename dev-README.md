# Dev Notes

- I'm going to use plain old CSS
  - It already has some CSS included, and I don't think it's worth it during this task to rip out the old code and add something like Tailwind; but if this was production or a long-term project I would use something else
  - for the patient list component I used CSS modules to scope the styles to the component
- I'm going to copy the fonts locally
  - The CDN fonts didn't match the design font weights exactly, so I found the fonts on the antidote homepage and downloaded them to use
- I'm going to use Baseweb's Tabs component
  - It has a nice little animation :)
  - Baseweb was the best all round React UI library I found in [my past research](https://github.com/tbjgolden/design-systems-benchmarks)
- As for data fetching, I considered react-query or swr - but decided that for a single endpoint it would be overengineering it

For what it's worth, I must say that I'm not sure that there's anything I could realistically have shown in this assignment that would prove any more or less than looking over my Github or portfolio work - and so it makes me feel like I'm just wasting my time!

> Indeed, in my last assignment, the interviewer didn't even look at it

When a candidate has plenty of similar work publically available it would be both more useful and more considerate to ask them to go through some source code that they had worked on in the past.
